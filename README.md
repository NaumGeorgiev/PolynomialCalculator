# PolynomialCalculator
A school project in terminal that works with only rational numbers and can:
- add, subtract, multiply and divide polynomials
- multiply polynomial by a number
- find the value of a polynomial for a certain x
- find the GCD of two polynomials
- print Vieta's formulas for a polynomial
- change polynomial argument to (a+x) (not sure what for)
- decompose a polynomial

Project is far from done, Algorithms are slow and their implementations are hard to understand, so there are some bugs as well.
